A web-based version of the Carbon Footprint Email Tracker project would function as an online platform accessible via browsers, offering email carbon footprint estimation and visualization without requiring local software installation.
Key Features of a Web-Based Carbon Footprint Email Tracker

- *User Authentication:*  
  Secure login using OAuth integration for major email providers (Gmail, Outlook, etc.) to allow secure access to usersâ€™ email metadata.

- *Backend Email Metadata Processing:*  
  A server-side component using Java (Spring Boot or similar) or other technology to connect to email APIs via OAuth, retrieve email metadata such as counts and sizes, and calculate the carbon footprint using emission factors.

- *Data Storage:*  
  Use cloud databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB) to persist user data, email metadata, and carbon footprint history for ongoing trend analysis.

- *Interactive Dashboard:*  
  Web front end developed using JavaScript frameworks (React, Angular, Vue) to visualize carbon emission trends via charts and graphs, provide filters for time ranges, and show tips for footprint reduction.

- *Periodic Email Reports:*  
Automatically generate and send email summaries of footprint trends, usage stats, and recommendations using backend email services.

- *Scalability and Accessibility:*  
  Accessible from any device with a web browser, providing flexibility and real-time data synchronization.
